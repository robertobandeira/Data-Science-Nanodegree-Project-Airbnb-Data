## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
Having been born in Brazil, I'm stereotipically very passionate about soccer aand watch games from Brazil's league every week. I was curious to see what I could learn from this data about the league and potentially even create a model to make predictions.

## File Descriptions
All of the coding was done in the jupyter notebook titled "CRISP-DM". In that document, you can find multiple sections that go through:
* Business Understanding
* Data Understanding
* Modeling

I discuss the data wrangling and results from the models in the Modeling section and in the blog post tagged below.
## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@roberto-bandeiram/predicting-soccer-results-in-brazil-b89042ddf216).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
All the data used is from [Football Data](https://www.football-data.co.uk/brazil.php). You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the link.
